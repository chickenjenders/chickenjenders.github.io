        <h1>Waiting Room</h1>
        <p>
          Waiting Room is a short psychological horror game about guilt and
          acceptance. The game is made using Bitsy, a very limited game engine
          that requires creative solutions to utlize its full potential to
          create the game you want. I wanted to emit the discomfort and anxiety
          of guilt through the engine's styling, color palettes, and sound
          design. I also used Bitsy hacks in order to add the sounds used in the
          game, as well as to match the HTML to the game's theme. The game is a
          short experience, but I hope it leaves a lasting impression on the
          player.
