        <h1>Why Walk?</h1>
        <p>
          Why isn't there an educational game about walkable cities? Oh wait,
          now there is! "Why Walk?" is a 2D top-down game created for my
          Programming for Digital Media graduate course. It was made completely
          with javascript in the P5.play library. You play as a little character
          that you can move around the town and come across several issues
          limiting the city's walkability. You learn what the issue is and how
          it affects walkability, and can click to fix the issue. Overall, the
          game is very simplistic and was aimed to be more for children as an
          educational tool. I'm interested in further improving this game with
          added interactivity, score keeping elements, more information and
          problems to solve, and improved setting and character assets.
